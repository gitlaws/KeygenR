🎹 MIDI Generator – KeygenR

KeygenR is a lightweight, browser-based Angular app that uses AI to convert typed or spoken prompts into downloadable MIDI files for any DAW (e.g., Ableton, FL Studio, Logic Pro).

Unlike tools like Riffusion or Suno that generate full AI songs, KeygenR is built for producers who want quick, AI-powered MIDI—custom chords, melodies, or rhythms they can shape into their own music. Whether you're sketching an idea or laying down a full track, just describe what you want—“16 bars of Drake-style piano at 90 BPM” or “Neo-soul chords in the style of H.E.R.”—and get tailored MIDI patterns in seconds. Generate as many bars as you need, in any artist’s style or genre.
